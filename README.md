# Hello website!

This is my first web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

`Bhagawat Gita` (also `Bhagavad Gita`) is the holy sacred book of the Hindus. The verses or shlokas are written in Sanskrit language which is the oldest classical language from India. However, this language is not popular among common folks. So learning the sacred verses is quite hard. Yet, this holy scripture has something to offer to us in the 21st century. It is considered an influential management book to many leaders. 

So I was wondering on how to make it interesting for younger generation to engage in learning of this holy book. Then I hit upon an idea to gamify learning of these verses. How about a game of typing but the text are the transliterated Sanskrit verses from the Gita.

I developed "Bhagawat Gita Typing Game" as a web app to enable wide reach across device types (desktop, mobile, tablet) yet be OS agnostic. 

Now one can practice their typing skills on a verse from the Sacred book. Thus learning both the sacred text as well as practising typing skills at the same time. 

When one gets the typing of the verse right, then they will be presented with the meaning of the shloka in addition to the time taken for typing it.
